CAL."
  desc  "
    Some networking protocols may not meet organizational security requirements
to protect data and components.

    Application servers natively host a number of various features, such as
management interfaces, httpd servers and message queues. These features all run
on TCPIP ports. This creates the potential that the vendor may choose to
utilize port numbers or network services that have been deemed unusable by the
organization. The application server must have the capability to both
reconfigure and disable the assigned ports without adversely impacting
application server operation capabilities. For a list of approved ports and
protocols, reference the DoD ports and protocols website at
https://powhatan.iiie.disa.mil/ports/cal.html.
